These scripts are used to perform various actions.  
  
They are mainly developped for Windows/VisualStudio in mind, but we want to be as cross platform & cross IDE as possible, so if you find something wrong, please help us improve them :)  

 - Setup : GenerateProject + CompileShaders + StartVisual  
 - GenerateProject : Run CMake to generate/update the project
 - CompileShaders : Compile shaders using shaderc (and build it if not built yet)
 - StartVisual : Start IDE
